Copy Path for Text Files
===========================

These are just a few custom generators I use while doing Ruby development. They're in the Text bundle because I started with just a generic "Copy Path to File" file command but I ended up adding a couple more that are specific to Rails development as well.

Installation
============

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/aharpole/text-tmbundle.git "Text.tmbundle"
